# Natural-Image-Reconstruction-

Codes for natural image reconstruction at different temperatures

**Noted**: Dateset and model parameters are removed due to memory limit. You can check the share folder to find the indicated files.

If you only want to know the neural network I am using, check it in *neural_network_structure.py*

For analysis of transmission matrix at different temperature, see file [analysis.ipynb](matrix\analysis.ipynb).
